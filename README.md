# NOTE 

* The app is fully integrated with all parts (you will need to run the app in release mode).
* If some parts of app won't work, remove the POSENET module (then all the other parts will work).
* Both APIs are expire on 31/05/2024 , find a alternative you want the same functionalities.
* The Password Reset was also not working, remove that or fix that if you want too.
* App is connected to firebase, you will need to rebuild and reconnect with your firebase.
